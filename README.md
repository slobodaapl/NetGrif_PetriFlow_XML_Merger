# NetGrif Model XML Merger
This tool is a simple utility that allows merging of several NetGrif models into one.
Currently this only works if the model only contains places, transitions and arcs.
Roles, data, and more, are currently not yet supported and will not be carried over.


## Usage
Download the files or clone the repository to your chosen folder, then run the following command:

    python main.py path_to_your_input/input.txt desired_output_path/output.xml

The output will be a valid XML file loadable by NetGrif.
The input file has to have a specific format to be accepted:

    path_to_model1.xml,x,y
    path_to_model2.xml,x,y
    ...

The XML file must be generated by NetGrif when you save the model. The x and y must be positive integers, which specify the position of the model in the output file. The coordinate system starts at [0, 0] in the top left corner of the NetGrif modeler.

Any models you pass to the merger will be reset to [0, 0] and any arc modifications (position-wise) that you made will be lost, so you have to 'prettify' your models once they're merged.
